# Twitter and Spam Detection Using NLP

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks showcasing workflows for **data preprocessing** and **natural language processing (NLP)-based spam detection**. The projects focus on cleaning Twitter data and detecting spam messages using machine learning models.

---

## **Features**

### 1. **Twitter Data Cleaning (`Twitter_cleaning.ipynb`)**
- Focused on preprocessing raw Twitter data.
- **Steps involved:**
  - Removal of special characters, stop words, and URLs.
  - Tokenization of tweets.
  - Text normalization (e.g., lowercasing and lemmatization).
  - Handling missing values and duplicates.
- Final output: A clean dataset ready for further analysis or model training.

### 2. **Spam Detection Using NLP (`Spam_detection_nlp.ipynb`)**
- Implements spam detection on textual data using machine learning and NLP techniques.
- **Key steps:**
  - Feature extraction using TF-IDF or Bag-of-Words.
  - Model training using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Support Vector Machines (SVM).
  - Performance evaluation with metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.
- Final output: A trained and tested spam detection model.

## **Dependencies**
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries include:
  - `pandas`, `numpy`: Data manipulation.
  - `nltk`, `spacy`: NLP operations.
  - `scikit-learn`: Model training and evaluation.
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`: Visualizations.
